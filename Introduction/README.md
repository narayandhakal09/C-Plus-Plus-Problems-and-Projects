  - A variable refers to a storage location in the computer’s memory that one can set aside to save, retrieve, and manipulate data.  

- C++ Data Types
  - `int` is a type for storing integer (whole) numbers. An integer typically requires 4 bytes of memory space and ranges from -2³¹ to 2³¹-1.
  - `double` is a type for storing floating point (decimal) numbers. Double variables typically require 8 bytes of memory space.
  - `char` is a type for storing individual characters. Characters are wrapped in single quotes '. Characters typically require 1 byte of memory space and range from -128 to 127.
  - `string` is a type for storing text strings. Strings are wrapped in double quotes ".
